<h2>Task</h2>

This project classifies political affiliation from tweets using the long-short-term-memory network with attention (LSTM-Attn).  A convolutional neural network(CNN) model is in the CNN folder.  (The previous two are implemented with hyperparameter search)  Additional models such as LSTM, bi-directional LSTM, GRU, bi-directional GRU are in the RNN folder.  All code is implemented in Keras and Tensorflow.  Can be run in python 2 or python 3
